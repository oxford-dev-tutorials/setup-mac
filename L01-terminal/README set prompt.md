# Set the prompt

To shorten your prompt to (say) a dollar edit your .zshrc file

```zsh
nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add this line :

```bash
PROMPT='$ '
```

Then

- save using control-O (letter O)
- exit using control-X

If you restart your terminal the prompt will have changed.

# Set the terminal appearance

In Terminal->Settings either choose an existing profile or hit + at the bottom of the list to create a new one.

Make any changes you woul like and hit the "default" button at the bottom of the list

This will become the default profile when you open terminal next time.
