# markdown preview double-click disabled

When trying to copy source code from markdown files its very easy to accidentally double click ... and by default you are then taken to the source .md file

As you are likely to be copying stuff from the course repo README file ... you may wish to disable this behaviour.

This is how

- Open VS code in some temporary folder
- create and edit a README.md file and add some text
- right click on the file name at the top and select Open Preview
- double click in the file and you will see the behaviour

- Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl+ on windows, Cmd+ on macOS)
- search for markdown.preview.doubleClickToSwitchToEditor
- disable it
- close settings
- retest and the double click should no longer take you away

# VS Code Theme

you can change your theme with the theme switcher

- on Windows press Ctrl-K then Ctrl-T
- on Mac press Cmd-K then Cmd-T

I am using Dark High Contrast for videos to hopefully make it easy to read.
